abstract = {It is proven that typing with keyboards can be easily hacked by listening to the sound emanated. Previous researches show that a key can be distinguished by the frequency characteristics of a keystroke. Although the old attacks have an accuracy rate up to 80{\%}, they can be defended by keys with similar sounds. Moreover, the algorithms are complex. For keys with similar sounds to be distinguishable, we develop a new attack approach, acoustic triangulation attack. Simplicity and easy computation are the advantages. A key can be found by computing the differences in arrival times of a sound wave at two microphones. A series of experiments is performed. Surprisingly, by choosing 3 to 5 keys from a set of 104 keys, the recognition rate can be up to 80{\%} with a 5-minute computation. With similar technique, we are able to identify all the keys in a keyboard. Since the experimental tools and softwares can be easily obtained from shops and the Internet, it is possible for non-technical people to perform the attack. Therefore, keyboard acoustic triangulation attack is ever more threatening. -},

We present a novel attack taking as input a 10-minute sound recording of a user typing English text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96{\%} of typed characters. There is no need for a labeled training recording. Moreover the recognizer bootstrapped this way can even recognize random text such as passwords: In our experiments, 90{\%} of 5-character random passwords using only letters can be generated in fewer than 20 attempts by an adversary; 80{\%} of 10-character passwords can be generated in fewer than 75 attempts. Our attack uses the statistical constraints of the underlying content, English language, to reconstruct text from sound recordings without any labeled training data. The attack uses a combination of standard machine learning and speech recognition techniques, including cepstrum features, Hidden Markov Models, linear classification, and feedback-based incremental learning.},

In our approach, the legitimate user's typing patterns (e.g., durations of keystrokes and latencies between keystrokes) are combined with the user's password to generate a hardened password that is convincingly more secure than conventional passwords alone. In addition, our scheme automatically adapts to gradual changes in a user's typing patterns while maintaining the same hardened password across multiple logins, for use in file encryption or other applications requiring a long-term secret key. Using empirical data and a prototype implementation of our scheme, we give evidence that our approach is viable in practice, in terms of ease of use, improved security, and performance.},

@article{Gould2005,
	Abstract = {Recent work by Asonov and Agrawal [1] and Zhuang et al. [2] has shown that acoustic emanations from keyboards can be used to reconstruct the text that is being typed. This, in theory, allows for the retrieval of confidential information such as passwords by covertly recording sound from the keyboard, and thus poses a significant security threat. Their techniqueswork because different keys produce different acoustic signatures when struck by the typist. Classifiers can be built to detect these differences and language models help in establishing priors for the various key combinations. This paper looks at applying machine learning techniques to the identification and authentication of users based solely on the acoustic waveform generated as the user types on a keyboard. This is possible because, not only do different keys produce different sounds, but the same key sequence can produce different acoustic waveforms when typed by a different user. Classification accuracies of up to 98{\%}are reported on a small set of trial users. In one novel application, this kind of system can be used to biometrically harden users' passwords by incorporating each user's typing behavior as part of the authentication procedure (see Monrose et al. [3]).},

	Abstract = {It is proven that typing with keyboards can be easily hacked by listening to the sound emanated. Previous researches show that a key can be distinguished by the frequency characteristics of a keystroke. Although the old attacks have an accuracy rate up to 80{\%}, they can be defended by keys with similar sounds. Moreover, the algorithms are complex. For keys with similar sounds to be distinguishable, we develop a new attack approach, acoustic triangulation attack. Simplicity and easy computation are the advantages. A key can be found by computing the differences in arrival times of a sound wave at two microphones. A series of experiments is performed. Surprisingly, by choosing 3 to 5 keys from a set of 104 keys, the recognition rate can be up to 80{\%} with a 5-minute computation. With similar technique, we are able to identify all the keys in a keyboard. Since the experimental tools and softwares can be easily obtained from shops and the Internet, it is possible for non-technical people to perform the attack. Therefore, keyboard acoustic triangulation attack is ever more threatening. -},
